## About my christmass in Finland


Christmas is the most important celebration day in finland and special day since the actual santa clause or 
in Finnish called Joulupukki is actually located in Finland in a town called Lapland.This is the time of the 
year where every thing is closed and everybody's families get together and eat lunch and exchange gifts. 

This is my first itme spending christmass in Finland without actually seeing any snow.every year in finland 
at this time of the year before christmass the country will be full of light and snow but this year we are yet
to see any snow.
